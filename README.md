# Who exactly elected Biden?
A quick post-election analysis on Biden's vote gains in swing states

pull_data.py pulls 2016 election data from an API and scrapes 2020 election data from the NBC News Election site. All data are at the county level.

election_20.ipynb brings together all the data to make inferences about the change in voting patterns from 2016 to 2020 using simple data visualizations. It attempts to figure out the most important sources of votes that contributed to Biden's victory. However, as we will see in the analysis, Biden's winning position came from no single group of voters; rather, it was only achievable because he could bring together a whole range of voters. At the same time, this means that his position is very fragile and could fall apart in the next election if he loses the confidence of just a few groups of these supporters.
