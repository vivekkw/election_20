# The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election

## Overview

This election was a rather bitter struggle between Biden and Trump for the highest office in the land, where both sides were extremely enthusiastic about preventing the opposing candidate from winning the election. The election ended off with very close results in some key swing states that were eventually narrowly won by Biden. There were two key sources of Biden's vote gains. Firstly, the turnout in major Democratic counties soared in support of Biden. Secondly, Biden's position as a moderate won over some voters in counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2016. 

This is a quick post-election analysis that was done during the week of elections to analyse the contributions of each of these components to Biden's victory. I seek to do a simple analysis of the votes in swing states, namely Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 and won the election for Biden.

## Context: The split in the Democratic Party

Ever since the end of President Obama's presidency in 2016, there has been a struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party. This struggle reached a peak during the Democratic Primaries in 2020, where there were clear divides between the progressive and moderate candidates vying for the party nomination.

The progressive wing, initially led by Bernie Sanders, has sought to introduce more left-leaning policies with democratic socialist hues into the mainstream rhetoric. These policies have been well-supported by Democratic supporters primarily in urban areas where there are strong Democratic bases. Due to the radical nature of their proposals, their rhetoric has gained much traction in the media. However, this "far-left" rhetoric has made for easy fodder for Republican criticism and may turn away more moderate voters who dislike such radical ideas. Nonetheless, this wing of the party believes that the enthusiasm it generates among Democratic voters will generate a turnout that can win elections. 

On the other hand, the moderates have fought to preserve their once-dominant position in the party. Whether they believe in more moderate policies or the notion that a moderate stance is the only way to secure sufficient votes to win elections, the figures in this wing are adamant that the Democratic Party must preserve its center-left position. Midway through the Primaries, the moderate candidates rallied behind Biden to provide critical support that enabled him to clinch the nomination. They believe that their moderate position can draw swing voters away from Trump while still capturing many votes in heavily Democratic areas where voters are less enthusiastic about a moderate candidate.

Eventually, the progressive wing accepted Biden's victory in the Primaries and threw their strong support behind him in the Election. As such, Biden was able to build a wide coalition. He harnessed the enthusiasm generated by the progressives to boost turnout in urban areas and won over voters in Trump-dominated areas. So far, however, we still do not know how much each of these sources contributed to Biden's win. 

## Why does this matter?

Going forward, Biden must decide how exactly he should govern the country. To some degree, he must 'reward' all those who voted for him. This means that he has to implement policies that each side is enthusiastic about, while avoiding any particular policy that might turn them off. He must also make his cabinet choices with this in mind and select people who represent the entire spectrum of his base. The calculation of policies and cabinet positions will likely be correlated with the support he received from each part of his base. 

In the longer term, the struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party rages on. This election result will represent another key, albeit blurry, data point in the argument over which wing of the party can truly win elections. Therefore, it will have longer term implications when the party chooses its next leaders both in Congress and for President.
