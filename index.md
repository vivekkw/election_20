# Who exactly elected Biden?

This election saw a bitter struggle between Biden and Trump for the Presidency. Both bases were extremely enthusiastic about preventing the opposing candidate from winning the election. As a result, the election ended off with very close results in some key swing states that were eventually narrowly won by Biden. There were two key sources of Biden's vote gains. Firstly, the turnout in major Democratic counties soared in support of Biden. Secondly, Biden's position as a moderate won over some voters in counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2016. 

This is a quick post-election analysis that was done during the week of elections to analyse the contributions of each of these components to Biden's victory. I seek to do a simple analysis of the votes in swing states, namely Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 and won the election for Biden.

## The split in the Democratic Party

Ever since the end of President Obama's second term in 2016, there has been a struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party. This struggle reached a peak during the Democratic Primaries in 2020, where there were clear divides between the progressive and moderate candidates vying for the party nomination.

The progressive wing, led primarily by Bernie Sanders, has sought to introduce more left-leaning policies with democratic socialist hues into the party's rhetoric. These policies have been well-supported by Democratic supporters largely in urban areas where there are strong Democratic bases. Due to the radical nature of their proposals, their rhetoric has gained much traction in the media. However, this "far-left" rhetoric has made for easy fodder for Republican criticism and may turn away more moderate voters who dislike such radical ideas. Nonetheless, this wing of the party believes that the enthusiasm it generates among Democratic voters will generate a turnout that can win elections. 

On the other hand, the moderates have fought to preserve their once-dominant position in the party. Whether they truly believe in more moderate policies or hold the notion that a moderate stance is the only way to secure sufficient votes to win elections, the figures in this wing are adamant that the Democratic Party must preserve its center-left position. Midway through the Primaries, the moderate candidates dropped out of the race and rallied behind Biden to provide critical support that enabled him to clinch the nomination. They believe that their moderate position can draw swing voters away from the Republicans while still capturing sufficiently many votes in heavily Democratic areas where voters are less enthusiastic about a moderate candidate.

Eventually, the progressive wing accepted Biden's victory in the Primaries and threw their strong support behind him in the General Election. As such, Biden was able to build a wide coalition. He harnessed the enthusiasm generated by the progressives to boost turnout in urban areas and won over voters in Trump-dominated areas. So far, however, we still do not know how much each of these sources contributed to Biden's win. 

## Why does it matter who voted for Biden?

Going forward, Biden must decide how exactly he should govern the country. To some degree, he must 'reward' all those who voted for him. This means that he has to implement policies that each side is enthusiastic about, while avoiding any particular policy that might turn them off. He must also make his cabinet choices with his base in mind and select people who represent the entire spectrum of his base. The mix of policies and cabinet appointments will likely be correlated with the support he received from each part of his base. 

In the longer term, the struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party rages on. This election result will represent another key, albeit blurry, data point in the argument over which wing of the party can truly win elections and thus deserves to lead the party. Therefore, it will have longer term implications when the party chooses its next leaders both in Congress and for President. 

## The Approach

In the following visualizations, I seek to shed some light on where the gains in votes came from for each candidate and how the margins in various counties have shifted since the 2016 Election. Note that both candidates gained a significant number of votes across the board in the 2020 Election due to the increased turnout. Moreover, due to the lack of more detailed data (eg. at the level of individual voting stations) and the secrecy of the ballot, it is not possible to tell the difference between voters that have changed their votes and 2020 voters that did not vote in 2016. As such, this analysis will focus only on vote gains and shifts in support on a county-wide level.  

## The Data

Two key sources of data were used for these visualizations. First, the 2020 election data was scraped from NBC's website which provided breakdowns of votes by county. Meanwhile, 2016 election data was used to categorised counties and analyse shifts in voting patterns and was taken from opendatasoft [here][https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county/table/?disjunctive.state]. 

## Categorising the counties

This analysis is aimed at distinguishing Biden's gains in Democratic bases, where the progressive wing is popular, from his gains in other areas. The categorisation of the types of counties cannot be done using 2020 Election Data, so 2016 data was used instead for this purpose. Here, "blue" counties (Democrat-leaning counties) are defined as counties where Clinton won by 10 or more percentage points in 2016, "red" counties (Republican-leaning counties) are counties where Trump won by 10 or more percentage points in 2016 and "swing" counties are counties where the margin was less than 10 percentage points. 

## Biden's raw vote gains

The plot below shows the increase in number of votes won by Biden in 2020 compared to Clinton in 2016 across the different types of counties in the swing states won by Biden.

First, we should note that the largest source of raw vote gains in the "Blue Wall" (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) was actually red counties. These gains make sense when we think about how the "Blue Wall" used to be a Democratic stronghold and many voters are probably less partisan compared to other states - perhaps red counties in 2016 were not so red after all. This is also striking particularly because it does not fit in with the typical media narratives on elections. Often, the media focuses on how much Democratic candidates can squeeze out from blue zones and how much Republican candidates can make up for that in red zones. The reality, as this shows, is that there is a sizeable portion of people in red counties that voted for Biden and made significant contributions to his victory. 

The story in Georgia and Arizona, however, is fairly different. In Georgia, the largest source of vote gains was the blue counties. This backs up the credit that has been accorded to Stacey Abrams and her team in the days after the election for registering huge numbers of voters around urban areas. In Arizona, voters from swing counties made up the majority of Biden's gains. This is likely due to the relatively massive size of Maricopa county's population and its demographic changes that have caused the leftward shift in its political preferences.

## Conclusion

These results seem to suggest a rather difficult path forward for the Democratic Party in the near future, though it favours the moderates for the time being. The analysis seems to indicate that both supporters of the progressive wing and moderate swing voters were absolutely critical to Biden's success in this election. Without a significant boost from either group, Trump would likely have won the election. This means that neither side of the Democratic Party is dominant and neither can lead without the support of the other. In light of these insights, it is clear that a Presidential candidate from the progressive wing is certain to lose an election even to a candidate like Trump. Therefore, a moderate must continue to lead the party. However, this moderate must somehow be able to win the support of the progressive wing without losing his/her moderate position.
