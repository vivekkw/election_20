# Who exactly elected Biden?

## Overview

This election saw a bitter struggle between Biden and Trump for the Presidency. Both bases were extremely enthusiastic about preventing the opposing candidate from winning the election. As a result, the election ended off with very close results in some key swing states that were eventually narrowly won by Biden. There were two key sources of Biden's vote gains. Firstly, the turnout in major Democratic counties soared in support of Biden. Secondly, Biden's position as a moderate won over some voters in counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2016. 

This is a quick post-election analysis that was done during the week of elections to analyse the contributions of each of these components to Biden's victory. I seek to do a simple analysis of the votes in swing states, namely Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 and won the election for Biden.

## Context: The split in the Democratic Party

Ever since the end of President Obama's second term in 2016, there has been a struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party. This struggle reached a peak during the Democratic Primaries in 2020, where there were clear divides between the progressive and moderate candidates vying for the party nomination.

The progressive wing, led primarily by Bernie Sanders, has sought to introduce more left-leaning policies with democratic socialist hues into the party's rhetoric. These policies have been well-supported by Democratic supporters largely in urban areas where there are strong Democratic bases. Due to the radical nature of their proposals, their rhetoric has gained much traction in the media. However, this "far-left" rhetoric has made for easy fodder for Republican criticism and may turn away more moderate voters who dislike such radical ideas. Nonetheless, this wing of the party believes that the enthusiasm it generates among Democratic voters will generate a turnout that can win elections. 

On the other hand, the moderates have fought to preserve their once-dominant position in the party. Whether they truly believe in more moderate policies or hold the notion that a moderate stance is the only way to secure sufficient votes to win elections, the figures in this wing are adamant that the Democratic Party must preserve its center-left position. Midway through the Primaries, the moderate candidates dropped out of the race and rallied behind Biden to provide critical support that enabled him to clinch the nomination. They believe that their moderate position can draw swing voters away from the Republicans while still capturing sufficiently many votes in heavily Democratic areas where voters are less enthusiastic about a moderate candidate.

Eventually, the progressive wing accepted Biden's victory in the Primaries and threw their strong support behind him in the General Election. As such, Biden was able to build a wide coalition. He harnessed the enthusiasm generated by the progressives to boost turnout in urban areas and won over voters in Trump-dominated areas. So far, however, we still do not know how much each of these sources contributed to Biden's win. 

## Why does this matter?

Going forward, Biden must decide how exactly he should govern the country. To some degree, he must 'reward' all those who voted for him. This means that he has to implement policies that each side is enthusiastic about, while avoiding any particular policy that might turn them off. He must also make his cabinet choices with his base in mind and select people who represent the entire spectrum of his base. The mix of policies and cabinet appointments will likely be correlated with the support he received from each part of his base. 

In the longer term, the struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party rages on. This election result will represent another key, albeit blurry, data point in the argument over which wing of the party can truly win elections and thus deserves to lead the party. Therefore, it will have longer term implications when the party chooses its next leaders both in Congress and for President. 

## The Approach

In the following visualizations, I seek to shed some light on where the gains in votes came from for each candidate and how the margins in various counties have shifted since the 2016 Election. Note that both candidates gained a significant number of votes across the board in the 2020 Election due to the increased turnout. Moreover, due to the lack of more detailed data (eg. at the level of individual voting stations) and the secrecy of the ballot, it is not possible to tell the difference between voters that have changed their votes and 2020 voters that did not vote in 2016. As such, this analysis will focus only on vote gains and shifts in support on a county-wide level.  

## The Data

Two key sources of data were used for these visualizations. First, the 2020 election data was scraped from NBC's website which provided breakdowns of votes by county. Meanwhile, 2016 election data was used to categorised counties and analyse shifts in voting patterns and was taken from opendatasoft [here][https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county/table/?disjunctive.state]. 

## Categorising the counties

This analysis is aimed at distinguishing Biden's gains in Democratic bases, where the progressive wing is popular, from his gains in other areas. The categorisation of the types of counties cannot be done using 2020 Election Data, so 2016 data was used instead for this purpose. Here, Democratic counties are defined as counties where Clinton won by 10 or more percentage points in 2016, Republican counties are counties where Trump won by 10 or more percentage points in 2016 and swing counties are counties where the margin was less than 10 percentage points.
